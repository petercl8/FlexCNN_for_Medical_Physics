        "*1) Raytune in particular is constantly changing. Therefore, if you are running this code after the authors have ceased maintaining it and there are errors, these are likely due to RayTune classes, methods, or functions being changed. Unfortunately, these seem to happen on a regular basis, as the code is relatively new.*\n",

        "*2) This code was originally written to tune/train/test not just sinogram to image supervisory networks (sinogram-->image), but also image to sinogram supervisory networks, GANs, CycleGANs, and Cycle + Supervisory networks. These latter capabilities have not been updated, but much of the code survives for this functionality. In the future, the code may be updated once again have these capabilities.*\n",
