    "This code can perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Tune a CNN to directly reconstruct PET images from Sinograms (find a set of hyperparameters)\n",
    "*   Train a network with a given set of hyperparameters\n",
    "*   Test the network and record MSE and SSIM values for each image tested\n",
    "*   Visualize the data and test results\n",
    "*   Plot training curves, metric histograms, example images\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is organized into sections. The important sections that you can edit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **User Parameters** - Edit important user parameters and decide what the code will do\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Configuration Dicts: Supervisory** - Dictionary for supervised learning. Make sure this matches the CNN loaded by the checkpoint file, if you are loading from a checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these, you may find that running a single cell is useful when all variables/classes/files have been loaded into memory. This can be quicker than running everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells nested under **Analysis Functions** each have their own changeable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Raytune in particular is constantly changing. Therefore, if you are running this code after the authors have ceased maintaining it and there are errors, these are likely due to RayTune classes, methods, or functions being changed. Unfortunately, these seem to happen on a regular basis, as the code is relatively new.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) This code was originally written to tune/train/test not just sinogram to image supervisory networks (sinogram-->image), but also image to sinogram supervisory networks, GANs, CycleGANs, and Cycle + Supervisory networks. These latter capabilities have not been updated, but much of the code survives for this functionality. In the future, the code may be updated once again have these capabilities.*\n",
