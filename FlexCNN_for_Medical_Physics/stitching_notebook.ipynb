My solution is to let the dataloader handle its own business (detect data structure sizes, since it has access to them) but let the user determine the number ofgenerator channels, since the generator does not see the data until after it has been instantiated. Also, the user only determines channels for currently trained network. Any frozen networks are always an attenuation network, so I hardcode channel information for dataloader and generator accordingly. Conclusion: sino_channels and image_channels represent the input and output channels for the generator for the currently trained network only.\n"
